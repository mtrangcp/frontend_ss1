    <h1 >Dance Monkey</h1>

    <p>
        [Verse 1] <br> They say, "Oh my god, I see the way you shine <br>
        Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine" <br>
        You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by <br>
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        [Pre-Chorus] <br>
        Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time <br>
        And oh my, I, I, I like your style <br>
        You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry <br>
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        [Chorus] <br>
        So they say <br>
        "Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh <br>
        I've never seen anybody do the things you do before" <br>
        They say <br>
        "Move for me, move for me, move for me, eh-eh-eh <br>
        And when you’re done, I'll make you do it all again" <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        [Verse 2] <br>
        I said, "Oh my god, I see you walking by <br>
        Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes" <br>
        Just like a monkey, I've been dancin’ my whole life <br>
        But you just beg to see me dance just one more time <br>
        [Pre-Chorus] <br>
        Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time <br>
        And oh my, I, I, I like your style <br>
        You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry <br>
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        [Chorus] <br>
        So they say <br>
        "Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh <br>
        I've never seen anybody do the things you do before" <br>
        They say <br>
        "Move for me, move for me, move for me, eh-eh-eh <br>
        And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again" <br>
        They say <br>
        "Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh <br>
        I've never seen anybody do the things you do before" <br>
        They say <br>
        "Move for me, move for me, move for me, eh-eh-eh <br>
        And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again" <br>
